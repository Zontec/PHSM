### Client

The client could simply run ***python3 client.py***. The CLI is very straightforward. For the connection, one could type ***con <login> <password>***. The rest of the functions will not require the login and password as will use token. The supported commands could be found in the file ***Protocol.py***. The tool has no any specific output system for the current version so the received results will be printed to the CLI.
